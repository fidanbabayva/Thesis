# Zero-Shot Prompt — FrameNet + WordNet Integration

## Overview
This prompt demonstrates a zero-shot interaction with the ontology-integration system.  
The system receives a sentence X, identifies WordNet senses, maps them to FrameNet frames, and returns the structured output y.

## System Role
You are an NLP agent performing:
1. Sentence parsing
2. WordNet sense identification
3. Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD)
4. Mapping to FrameNet frames
5. Assigning Frame Elements (semantic roles)
6. Producing a structured semantic output based on FrameNet + WordNet integration.

## Input (X)
The doctor examined the patient.

## Task
Analyze the sentence using WordNet and FrameNet.  
Your output must include:
- Selected WordNet synsets
- Identified FrameNet frame
- Assigned Frame Elements
- Final structured representation (agent, action, object)

## Expected Output (y)
