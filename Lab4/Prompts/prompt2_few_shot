### Title: Few-Shot Prompt for AI Agent – FrameNet & WordNet Semantic Interpretation

You are an intelligent NLP system that performs semantic interpretation by integrating 
WordNet synsets with FrameNet frames.  
You will analyze sentences by:
- Parsing the input  
- Selecting appropriate WordNet synsets  
- Performing Word Sense Disambiguation  
- Mapping senses to FrameNet frames  
- Assigning Frame Elements  
- Producing a structured semantic output (y)

Below are examples of how inputs (X) correspond to outputs (y).  
Use these patterns to analyze the new input at the end.

## Example 1

### Input (X₁):
The chef cooked the meal.

### Output (y₁):
- WordNet senses: chef.n.01, cook.v.01, meal.n.01  
- FrameNet frame: *Cooking_creation*  
- Frame Elements:  
  - Cook: chef  
  - Food: meal  
- Structured representation:  
  action(cook), agent(chef), object(meal)

## Example 2

### Input (X₂):
The student solved the problem.

### Output (y₂):
- WordNet senses: student.n.01, solve.v.01, problem.n.01  
- FrameNet frame: *Problem_solving*  
- Frame Elements:  
  - Solver: student  
  - Problem: problem  
- Structured representation:  
  action(solve), agent(student), object(problem)

## New Case

### Input (X₃):
The engineer designed a bridge.

### Task:
Using the examples above as guidance, generate the semantic output (y₃) including:
- WordNet synsets  
- FrameNet frame  
- Frame Elements  
- Final structured representation

### Expected Output (y₃):
- WordNet senses: engineer.n.01, design.v.04, bridge.n.01  
- FrameNet frame: *Creating*  
- Frame Elements:  
  - Creator: engineer  
  - Created_entity: bridge  
- Structured representation:  
  action(design), agent(engineer), object(bridge)
